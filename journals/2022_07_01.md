	- 如果人生始终如此，我们将永远无法 Reach the stage of Enough
	- > **Enough is elusive because when you reach it, you’re no longer the person that once desired it.**

	- You act like a mortal in all that you fear, and an immortal in all that you desire.
	- > You can't touch or feel time, so it's hard for you to really grasp it. If your doctor told you that you had a deadly illness, you'd spend every cent you have to try to stay alive.
