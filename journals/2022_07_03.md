- The paradox of our existence
	- We are aware of our finiteness, but view life through the lens of the infinite.
	- We are wasting our daily life, but always saying that time is too short.
	- When life really comes to an end, all regrets come, but doesn't gonna change anything.
	- Be grateful for each day, live with caution and heart.

	- Once we realize that nothing will persist forever, even every moment in our life will end, so we shall be grateful for what we care, who care us.
	- From the big moment to the small moment to the micro moment, none of such will last forever, smaller one shorter.
	- 凡事终有尽头，要感激生活中的点滴

	- _Rich people need it. Poor people have it. If you eat it, you die. And when you die, you take it with you. What is it?_
		- Rich people need nothing. Poor people have nothing. If you eat nothing, you die. And when you die, you take nothing with you.
	- **Money is a required pursuit for life, but a pointless pursuit upon death.**
	- 现代的钱仅仅只是一般等价物，而不是具有实际价值的物体。
	- 换句话说，现代人对于金钱的追求，实际上也就是对社会认同的追求。
	- 也就是说，社会反过来放大了「人」对社会的认知和需求。

	- **Individual goals matter less, while overall buying power matters more.**
	- **Money is both the great everything and the great nothing.**
	- 由于市场经济的作祟，现代的人分工明确，最大的可能性就在既定的路线上走完一生。
	- 尤其是内卷化加剧的近几年，从孩子出生前就是激烈的角逐，学区房，教师资源，挣钱，为后期做准备等等；那么等待孩子的会是什么，基本确定的道路，加入更加激烈的竞争当中。
