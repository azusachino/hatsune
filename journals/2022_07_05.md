			- If you want to express your individual power by buying yachts, wearing gold chains, and balling out at night clubs, then that does two things.

	- > If you view the world through the lens of scarcity and survival, money will only amplify that feeling of inadequacy. But if freedom is what defines you, then money will feel abundant, no matter how much you have. If power and influence is what you want, then money will drive the nature of your relationships in that direction.
