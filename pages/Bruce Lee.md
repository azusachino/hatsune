- **The less promise and potency in the self, the more imperative is the need for pride. The core of pride is self-rejection**
- ## Contents
	- ### Will Power
		- Recognizing that the power of will is the supreme court over all other departments of my mind, I will exercise it daily, when I need the urge to action for any purpose; and I will form `HABIT` designed to bring the power of my will into action at least once daily.
	- ### Emotion
		- Realizing that my emotions are both positive and negative, I will form daily `HABIT`s which will encourage the development of the the `POSITIVE EMOTIONS`, and aid me in converting the negative emotions into some form of useful action.
	- ### Reason
		- Recognizing that both my positive & negative emotions may be dangerous if they are not controlled and guided to desirable ends, I will submit all my desires, aims and purposes to my faculties of reason, and I will be guided by it in giving expression to these.
	- ### Imagination
		- Recognizing the need for sound `PLANS` and `IDEAS` for the attainment for my desires, I will develop my imagination by calling upon it daily for help in the formation for my plans.
	- ### Memory
		- Recognizing the value of an alert memory, I will encourage mine to become alert by taking care to impress it clearly with all thoughts I wish to recall, and by associating those thoughts with related subjects which I may call to mind frequently.
	- ### Subconscious Mind
		- Recognizing the influence of my subconscious mind over my power of will, I shall take care to submit to it a clear and definite picture of my `CLEAR PURPOSE` in life and all minor purposes leading to my major purpose, and I shall keep this picture `CONSTANTLY BEFORE` my subconscious mind by `REPEATING IT DAILY`.
	- ### Conscience
		- Recognizing that my emotions often err in their over-enthusiasm and my faculty of reason often is without the warmth of feeling that is necessary to enable me to combine justice with mercy in my judgements, I will encourage my conscience to guide me as to what is right & what is wrong, but I will never set aside the verdicts it renders, no matter what may be the cost of carrying them out.
- ## Quotation
	- You will never get any more out of life than you expect
	  Keep your mind on the things you want and off those you don't
	  Things live by moving and gain strength as they go
	  Be a calm beholder of what is happening around you
	  There is a difference between the world and our reaction to it
	  Be aware of our conditioning! Drop and dissolve inner blockage
	  Inner to outer --- We start by dissolving our attitude not by altering outer condition
	  See that there is no one to fight, only an illusion to see through
	  No one can hurt you unless you allow him to
	  Inwardly, psychologically, be a nobody
	- I know that I have the ability to `ACHIEVE` the object of my `DEFINITE PURPOSE` in life; therefore I `DEMAND` of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action.
	  
	  I realize the `DOMINATING THOUGHTS` of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality; therefore I will `CONCENTRATE` my thoughts for 30 mins. Daily upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear `MENTAL PICTURE`.
	  
	  I know through the principle of autosuggestion, any desire that I `PERSISTENTLY` hold will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it; therefore, I will devote 10 min. Daily to `DEMANDING` of myself the development of `SELF_CONFIDENCE`.
	  
	  I have clearly written down a description of my `DEFINITE CHIEF AIM` in life, and I will never stop trying until I shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.
