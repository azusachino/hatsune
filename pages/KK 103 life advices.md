	- Anything you say before the word "but" doesn't count.
	- When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.
	- Courtesy costs nothing. Lower the toilet seat after use. Let the people in the elevator exit before you enter. Return shopping carts to their designated areas. When you borrow something, return it better shape (filled up, cleaned) than when you got it.
	- Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.
	- Efficiency is high overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.
	- When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.
	- Criticize in private, praise in public.
	- Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is with you. Once you have truly learned a lesson, you will be presented with the next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.

	- Making art is not selfish; it's for the rest of us. If you don't do your thing, you are cheating us.
	- Never ask a woman if she is pregnant. Let he tell you if she is.
	- Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two.
	- When public speaking, pause frequently. Pause before you say something in a new way, pause after you have said something you believe is important, and pause as a relief to let listeners absorb details.

	- Use a password manager: Safer, easier, better.
	- Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.
	- The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even in failure it may be a success measured by the ordinary.
	- A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others,
	- Keep all your things visible in a hotel room, not in drawers, and all gathered into one spot. That way you'll never leave anything behind. If you need to have something like a charger off to the side, place a couple of other large items next to it, because you are less likely to leave 3 items behind than just one.
	- Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks, even if you believe it is not deserved.
	- Always read the plaque next to the monument.
	- When you have some success, the feeling of being an imposter can be real. Who am I fooling?

	- You will be judged on how well you treat those who can do nothing for you.
	- We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade. Miraculous things can be accomplished if you give it ten years. A long game will compound small gains to overcome even big mistakes.
