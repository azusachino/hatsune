- What is the truth of the universe?
- If the universe is a play, the particles are actors, and the gravity is the stage.
- $Gravity + Standard Model = The Theory of Everything$

		- This video actually didn't `explained` what is String Theory, but simply mentioned the context about why there is such theory come out. In [[Quantum-Physics]] world, general relational theory cannot explain it all, people need new theories to explain new observed-situations, and String Theory is one of them.
		- Still no prediction of string theory has been proven in an experiment
